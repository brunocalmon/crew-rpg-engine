# Ruling: Cautious Alliance

After careful consideration of Ms. Duskveil's testimony and Bellatrix's analysis, I have reached the following decision:

We will extend a cautious alliance to Ms. Duskveil.

## Justification:

*   **Shared Connection:** Ms. Duskveil has demonstrated a clear connection to the crimson sigils and the ruined cathedral, indicating a sensitivity to the lingering energies of that location.
*   **Valuable Skills:** As a Dhampir Blood Hunter, Ms. Duskveil possesses skills in tracking, blood magic, and investigation that could prove invaluable in exploring the cathedral and understanding the nature of the sigils.
*   **Potential Threat:** While Ms. Duskveil does not appear to have prior knowledge of Vorlag or my personal history, her sensitivity to the cathedral's energies could lead her to uncover dangerous secrets. A controlled alliance allows us to monitor her activities and mitigate this risk.

## Conditions of Alliance:

*   **Transparency:** Ms. Duskveil must be forthcoming with any information she uncovers regarding the sigils, the cathedral, and her own experiences.
*   **Discretion:** Ms. Duskveil must agree to keep the nature of her discoveries, and my past association with them, confidential.
*   **Mutual Benefit:** The alliance will be based on mutual benefit, with both parties contributing their skills and resources to achieve a common goal. This goal will be to understand the current nature of the sigils.

## Next Steps:

*   Initiate a dialogue with Ms. Duskveil to clearly communicate the terms of the alliance and gauge her willingness to cooperate.
*   Begin preparations for an expedition to the ruined cathedral, taking into account the potential dangers and the need for caution.
*   Continue to monitor Ms. Duskveil's behavior and motivations, remaining vigilant for any signs of treachery or hidden agendas.
